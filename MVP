MVP

-Has a board
-Displays user names
-Takes turns: alternates marking an x and o on the board
-Will not allow you to click on a space already filled, but if you do will simply do nothing or generate an error, and WILL NOT revert to the other persons turn skipping you
-Will measure a win when there are three x's or o's in a row: when it achieves win state it will break out of the turn function and end the game, making the remaining tiles unclickable and leaving the only user story possible to be clicking the start button and beginning the game again

PRIMARY GOALS AFTER HITTING MVP

My code is not dry at all, needs some major work. 

STRETCH

Some type of animation onclick, likely I'd search gifs for xs and os being drawn

A background image that make it look polished

Nav bar and ability to navigate to some external related pages (not necessary, but flesh out the feel of the site)

SUPER stretch would be an ultimate score mechanism to let the same two players play the game more than once, and track the total games each side won
