//onload shows board, prompts for player one and player two name
//


//GAME LOGIC
//If an odd turn, onclick set div to x
//If an even turn, onclick set div to o
//On all turns, set a status of clicked to tile (so it can't be reclicked)
//After click run a function evaluating if there are three tiles of the same type in a row
//If the answer is yes, run an alert with the winner

//Reset button puts all the tiles back to having no value, and ideally if I can get player names populating 
//resets the prompt asking for their names again

//		EVALUATING WINS
 	 //Could assign number values and use a modulo so that certain matches would all be divisible by the same number
 	 //but ironically while more DRY might get kind of mathematically complicated
 	 //Could use some kind of letter & number combo to mark rows and columns
 	 //Could just use letters
	 // Upon thought, I think this is the best way: 

	   //        Column A    Column B     Column C 
	   // Row1      1A         1B           1C
	   // Row2      2A         2B           2C
	   // Row3      3A         3B           3C

//EDGE CASE
//Diagonal win: no way around it, this is a toughie. I think I will just have to use a not particularly dry
// if div 2B inner html = 1a && 3c html, then..../if div 2b innerhtml = 1c and 3a html then...
