//onload shows board, prompts for player one and player two name
//


//GAME LOGIC
//If an odd turn, onclick set div to x
//If an even turn, onclick set div to o
//On all turns, set a status of clicked to tile (so it can't be reclicked)
//After click run a function evaluating if there are three tiles of the same type in a row
//If the answer is yes, run an alert with the winner

//Reset button puts all the tiles back to having no value, and ideally if I can get player names populating 
//resets the prompt asking for their names again
