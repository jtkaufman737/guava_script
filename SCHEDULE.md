SCHEDULE

DAY ONE: 
As of 5 pm roughly 30% of functionality I need attained in js; barebones html and css set up with good framework for enhancement; issues created, wireframe sketched out, ongoing tested

DAY TWO: 
I want to have finished functionality or at the very least be 80% done and dealing with only minor bugs

DAY THREE: 
CSS Day, at least the first half
Time permitting second half of the day will be drying out my code and working on stretch goals

DAY FOUR: 
First half of the day want CSS finalized, and a working prototype set to the side so I can tinker on remaining stretch goals and visual stuff safely. Last time I had version control issues and ended up losing some functionality in the wee hours of the presentation day. Don't want to make that mistake again.
